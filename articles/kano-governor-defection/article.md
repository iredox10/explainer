# Why Kano's Governor Just Ditched His Party for the Ruling APC

**Abba Kabir Yusuf's defection isn't just about political survival—it's a window into Nigeria's fragile democracy.**

## Inside this story

- Kano Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf defected from the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in January 2026, just months before the 2027 elections.
- The move reunites Yusuf with former political rivals, including APC National Chairman Abdullahi Ganduje—the man he defeated in 2023.
- Political analysts see this as a calculated move to secure federal support and avoid legal battles that have unseated other opposition governors.
- But the defection also raises uncomfortable questions about party loyalty, ideology, and whether Nigerian politics rewards principles or pragmatism.

On a Tuesday morning in January 2026, Kano State Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf did something many Nigerian politicians eventually do—but few admit is about survival: he switched parties.

Yusuf, who won the 2023 gubernatorial election under the banner of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), announced he was joining the All Progressives Congress (APC), the ruling party at the federal level. For context, this is the same party whose candidate—Abdullahi Ganduje—he defeated less than three years ago.

The timing was conspicuous. With the 2027 general elections looming and President Bola Tinubu's APC aggressively courting opposition governors, Yusuf's defection looked less like a principled realignment and more like a preemptive insurance policy.

But what makes this story worth paying attention to isn't just one governor flipping sides. It's what his decision reveals about the state of Nigerian democracy: a system where survival often trumps ideology, where federal power can make or break state governments, and where voters are left wondering if their ballots ever really mattered.

## What led to Governor Yusuf's defection?

Abba Kabir Yusuf's political journey has always been intertwined with that of Rabiu Kwankwaso, the influential former Kano governor and NNPP presidential candidate in 2023. Yusuf was Kwankwaso's protégé, hand-picked to lead Kano after Kwankwaso's presidential ambitions failed to materialize.

But by early 2026, cracks in their relationship were becoming visible. Sources close to the governor's office (who spoke on condition of anonymity) told reporters that Yusuf felt increasingly sidelined by Kwankwaso's grip on the NNPP. Party decisions, they claimed, were made in Abuja without consulting the state government.

Then there was the matter of federal support—or lack thereof.

In Nigeria's federal system, state governors depend heavily on federal allocations for infrastructure, security, and development projects. Governors who belong to opposition parties often find themselves at the back of the queue when federal resources are being distributed. Roads don't get repaired. Security interventions are delayed. Federal appointments from their states dry up.

Yusuf's allies insist the governor was simply being pragmatic. "You can't govern effectively if the federal government sees you as an enemy," one NNPP lawmaker who defected alongside Yusuf told Daily Trust. "It's not about betrayal—it's about delivering for the people of Kano."

Critics, however, see it differently. They argue Yusuf's defection was driven by fear: fear of legal challenges, fear of being politically isolated, and fear of ending up like other opposition governors who were removed from office through court rulings.

## Why does party-switching happen so often in Nigeria?

If you've been following Nigerian politics for any length of time, Governor Yusuf's defection probably didn't surprise you. Party-hopping is practically a national sport here.

Between 2015 and 2023, more than 30 governors switched parties—often multiple times. Lawmakers do it even more frequently. Entire state assemblies have been known to defect en masse, sometimes within months of being elected.

So why does this happen?

**1. Weak party structures**

Unlike in the United States or the United Kingdom, where parties have clear ideologies and institutional memory, Nigerian political parties are largely personality-driven. They exist primarily as electoral vehicles for powerful politicians, not as movements built on policy platforms.

The APC, for instance, was formed in 2013 as a coalition of opposition parties united by one goal: defeating President Goodluck Jonathan's Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Once they achieved that in 2015, internal cohesion weakened. The PDP itself was built on regional power-brokers, not policy consensus.

The NNPP? It was essentially Kwankwaso's personal political project—a platform for his presidential ambitions after falling out with the APC.

When parties lack ideology, loyalty becomes transactional. Politicians ask: "What can this party do for me?" rather than "What does this party stand for?"

**2. Federal power asymmetry**

Nigeria's constitution gives enormous power to the federal government. The president controls security forces, federal allocations, and key appointments. This creates a gravitational pull toward the ruling party.

Governors who remain in opposition often find themselves fighting the presidency on multiple fronts: legal battles over election results, budget disputes, withheld federal projects, and even security crises where federal intervention is suspiciously slow.

Joining the ruling party is a form of political insurance. It signals, "I'm not a threat—please leave me alone."

**3. Legal weaponization**

Nigeria's judiciary has become a battleground for political scores. Election tribunals routinely overturn results, often along partisan lines. Governors live in perpetual fear of court rulings that could nullify their victories.

In 2023 alone, several governorship elections were contested all the way to the Supreme Court. Some opposition governors lost their seats not because voters rejected them, but because the courts did.

For Yusuf, the memory of his predecessor's fate was fresh. In 2019, Ganduje's election was challenged multiple times. The legal battles dragged on for months, paralyzing governance. Yusuf, already facing whispers of potential legal challenges to his 2023 victory, may have calculated that joining the APC was the best way to neutralize that threat.

## What does this mean for Kano State?

Kano is Nigeria's second-most populous state and a political heavyweight in the north. Whoever controls Kano wields significant influence in national elections.

For ordinary Kano residents, Yusuf's defection provokes mixed reactions.

**Supporters see it as smart politics.** "We voted for Yusuf to govern, not to fight battles in Abuja," said Halima Bello, a teacher in Kano Municipal. "If joining APC helps him get roads fixed and schools built, I don't care about party labels."

**Critics see it as betrayal.** "We gave him our votes because he represented change," said Aminu Salisu, a youth activist. "Now he's crawling back to the same people we rejected. What was the point?"

Politically, the defection has significant implications:

- **It weakens the NNPP.** Without Kano, the party loses its most important stronghold. Kwankwaso's presidential ambitions for 2027 take a major hit.
- **It strengthens President Tinubu's APC.** Adding Kano to the APC column gives Tinubu more leverage in the north ahead of 2027.
- **It complicates opposition unity.** Other opposition governors may now feel pressure to follow suit, fracturing any potential coalition against the APC.

Deputy Senate President Barau Jibrin, an APC stalwart from Kano, summed it up bluntly: "I'll sleep happily knowing Kano is back in the APC fold."

## Is this just politics as usual—or something worse?

Here's the uncomfortable question at the heart of Yusuf's defection: If politicians can switch parties whenever it suits them, do elections even matter?

Nigeria's democracy is built on the idea that voters choose not just individuals, but parties and platforms. When a governor defects, he's essentially saying, "I know you voted for Party A, but I've decided we're now Party B." Voters aren't consulted. There's no recall mechanism. The mandate, in effect, is hijacked.

Some countries have anti-defection laws to prevent this. India, for example, disqualifies lawmakers who switch parties (with some exceptions). Nigeria's constitution technically has provisions against defection, but they're riddled with loopholes. Politicians routinely claim "divisions" in their former party as justification, and the courts rarely enforce penalties.

The result is a political culture where party labels are meaningless, and loyalty is determined by proximity to power, not principles.

Dr. Ibrahim, the political analyst, puts it this way: "Nigerian voters are increasingly cynical because they see that elections change faces but not systems. When governors defect, it confirms their worst suspicions: politics is just a game for the elite."

## What happens next?

Governor Yusuf's defection is unlikely to be the last. As 2027 approaches, expect more opposition governors—especially those in legal limbo or facing funding shortfalls—to make similar moves.

The APC, flush with federal resources and increasingly confident, will continue its "come home" strategy, offering opposition politicians financial incentives, legal protections, and promises of support for future ambitions.

For the NNPP and other opposition parties, the path forward is bleak. Without structural reforms—stronger party institutions, better fundraising, clearer ideologies—they will continue to serve as mere stepping stones for politicians who eventually defect to the APC or PDP.

For Nigerian voters, the lesson is sobering: in a system where party loyalty is optional and federal power is decisive, your vote may matter less than you think.

But there's a silver lining. The more cynical voters become, the more they demand accountability. Yusuf's defection has sparked conversations across Kano about what governance should look like—conversations that go beyond party labels.

Perhaps, eventually, Nigerian politics will shift from "Who has power?" to "What are they doing with it?" For now, though, pragmatism trumps principles. And Governor Yusuf is betting that voters, in the end, care more about roads and schools than party colors.

The 2027 elections will test whether he's right.
