## CONTENT BLOCKS (NON-IMAGE ELEMENTS)

### "INSIDE THIS STORY" BOX
**Location:** Immediately after hero image, before the first paragraph of body text  
**Style:** Light background (#F5F5F5), bullet points, max-width 680px  
**Content:**
- Kano Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf defected from the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in January 2026, just months before the 2027 elections.
- The move reunites Yusuf with former political rivals, including APC National Chairman Abdullahi Ganduje—the man he defeated in 2023.
- Political analysts see this as a calculated move to secure federal support and avoid legal battles that have unseated other opposition governors.
- But the defection also raises uncomfortable questions about party loyalty, ideology, and whether Nigerian politics rewards principles or pragmatism.
